// Century From Year

// Given a year, return the century it is in.


// The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100,
// the second century - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.


function century(year) {
    // Finish this :)
    let x = Math.ceil(year/ 100);
    return x
}
console.log(century(1900))
